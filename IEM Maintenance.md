*Diagnosing a problem with your IEMs*
Source:  Significant noise floor (background static / hiss) is a common symptom of inadequate sources paired with sensitive IEMs. Plug IEMs in to various 3.5mm devices you have and determine if issues you hear are isolated to specific devices.
Cable: Inconsistent audio cutting in and out or no audio whatsoever are potential signs of a malfunctioning cable. In lieu of purchasing a new cable, you can swap the left and right sides to determine if the issue follows a specific side of the cable connection.
Nozzle filter: Reduced volume of an earphone (becoming quieter) is the main indicator of a clogged filter. At your own risk, remove the filters and listen for restored volume output. Beware that without filters the sound is likely brighter with more peaks. See below for more details about filters. 

*IEM nozzle filters*
Most 1DD IEMs have a mesh filter on the sound nozzle that protects inner components and tunes sound. Filters can clog in humid conditions and from moisture, ear wax, skin oils, etc. with use over time. Besides mesh filter, some IEMs use Knowles tube dampers or foam.
Filters are available in different sizes (diameter in mm), and mesh density rated from 100 - 500. Higher numbers indicate greater acoustic damping, mostly affecting sound 2kHz - 6kHz. 500 mesh is common for stock sound replacement.
To replace a mesh filter: Using tweezers or a needle, remove the stock filter (and metal grille if applicable). Apply the replacement filter so that the pre-applied adhesive edges stick on the lip / groove in the nozzle. Lightly press down on the edges.

*Cleaning IEM shells and ear tips*
To remove wax and debris from ear tips and around an IEM nozzle, use a needle or fine metal loop cleaning tool. As you clean, hold the IEM at an angle so that gravity helps debris fall out and away.
Avoid using blunt instruments such as brushes or a cloth around the nozzle filter, as they can push debris further in or damage the filter.
A cloth or cleaning wipes can be used to wipe the exterior shell, but be careful around any ventilation holes the IEM has, and beware that alcohol and other chemicals may react with the shell exterior.
Silicone ear tips can be cleaned with warm water and mild soap. Dry thoroughly before placing on an IEM. 
Foam ear tips should not be wet cleaned and are meant to be replaced when they become dirty or aged.

*General ownership tips*
Store IEMs in an airtight container with desiccant such as silica gel packet. This helps manage moisture which accumulates during use.
Keep IEMs attached to their cable. This helps prolong the connection lifespan.
Roadie wrap cables. This helps cables remain free of kinks and unravel easily for use.
If you have cleaner ears, less wax transfers when wearing IEMs. Digital camera ear-picks and over-the-counter peroxide solution can help clean ears. Follow instructions and be careful when cleaning.
