Brick-and-mortar locations near you may affiliate with a manufacturer listed above or make their own custom in-ear monitors. They may offer demo units to listen to and ear impressions done on site.
Digital ear impressions are increasingly more common and enable a more streamlined online buying process. Contact and thoroughly define terms with both the manufacturer of the customs you desire and the person taking your ear impressions before financial commitment. You want all parties on the same page so that you have usable ear impressions and a manufacturer ready to work with them.
