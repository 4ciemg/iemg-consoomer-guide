A number sign "#" denotes in-line mic support.
A plus sign "+" denotes if EQ is an advertised feature. Functionality and implementation differs.
A percent sign "%" denotes Bluetooth connectivity.

Flawless compatibility is not assured when using dongles and smartphones. For some device pairings, unstable connection, noise artifacts / glitches, or wireless signal interference can occur. Apple Lightning imposes power limitations compared to USB-C.
For bit-perfect lossless audio via Android phone and dongle, use HiBy Music (free) or USB Audio Player Pro aka UAPP (paid) and enable "Exclusive USB Audio Access," setting to avoid resampling.

With manufacturer specifications for sensitivity and impedance, you can calculate the power required for IEMs.

Most IEMs are very sensitive and require little power to reach loud volumes. Excessive amplifiers may even be detrimental to your listening experience (e.g., higher audible noise floor, limited usable volume steps, generate excessive heat, drain more power, etc.).
