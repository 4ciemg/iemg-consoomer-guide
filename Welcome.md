# /iemg/ - In-Ear Monitor General Shopping Guide

***

!!!tip Keep in Mind
Aesthetics, wearing comfort, and perceived sound quality are all matters of subjective experience. Ear anatomy, hearing ability, and preferences for sound tilt vary. Take impressions and reviews with a grain of salt. 
!!!

!!!warning Multi-Driver IEMs
Source output impedance >2.0 ohms may alter the frequency response of multi-driver IEMs. Most computer motherboards have significant output impedance, thus are unreliable for using multi-driver IEMs. Single dynamic driver (1DD) IEMs are typically unaffected.
!!!

!!!warning IEM Shell Material
Metal shells are prone to moisture condensation and clogged filters. This does not mean that every user encounters issues, nor does it mean that plastic shells are immune. For more details, refer to the IEM Maintenance section.

!!!base Navigating This Guide
Within sub-categories, names are primarily listed by price (low to high) or alphabetically (A to Z).
Sound descriptors given for IEMs are weak approximations. Refer to frequency response graphs for better insight. 
A tilde "~" denotes if adjustable sound tuning is advertised (e.g., exchangeable nozzles, DIP switch, impedance adapter, or DSP cable).
There are resources for newcomers, sister sites for EQ and community impressions, and more in the Helpful External Links section.
